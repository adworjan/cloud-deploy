# Self-Service Automation of Infrastructure and Linux Applications on Amazon Web Services with ServiceNow

Here you will find Ansible playbooks to automate the deployment of linux servers and applications on AWS. These playbooks are meant to be primarily for demonstrations, showing the "art of the possible" and ephemeral in nature. Additionally, these playbooks are meant to be run as part of an Ansible Tower Workflow rather than run independently. This document assumes you have Ansible Tower 3.7 installed, and will walk you through the setup process.

**Prerequisites**:

- [Ansible Tower 3.7+ installation Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/quickinstall/index.html).
- [Ansible Tower 60-day trial license](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/try-it).
- [ServiceNow Developer Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/guide/orlando/now-platform/pdi-guide/obtaining-a-pdi).
